            <p class = 'paragraph'> 
                Hello! You may know me as @eggnaut, but that's just a username. There's a lot more!
                I'm a 13 year old boy (he/him) who likes to code.
                I have other hobbies (apart from coding), like playing soccer and watching movies with my family.
                My favorite programming language is Python.
                I like to develop games and have recently started getting into web dev and software dev.
                I've begun to get into open source because I want to build software with a community.
            </p>
